# Biography

Hi, I'm Dan, a post-baccalaureate student pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Colorado. I have a fascination with machine learning and deep learning which has led me to a research assistant position underneath Dr. Terrance Boult where I spend most of my time fiddling with computer vision and adversarial example research. 

Outside of class and the lab, I spend most of my time doing research into audio recognition and generation where I've trained several Sequence-to-Sequence networks and a couple WaveNets. Furthermore, distributed computing and load balancing have recently caught my attention and I've begun to dabble in both Docker and Kubernetes.
